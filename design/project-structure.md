### How This Structure Helps Add New Features

1. **New Screens**:
   - Place new screens (like `ai_tab_screen.dart`, `device_tab_screen.dart`, `tools_tab_screen.dart`) inside the `screens/` folder. This keeps the app's main navigation centralized.

2. **Feature-Specific Logic**:
   - For each tab, create a folder inside `features/` (e.g., `ai_tab/`, `devices_tab/`, `tools_tab/`).
   - Add feature-specific files like business logic (`*_logic.dart`) and shared widgets (`*_widgets.dart`) to keep related files together.

3. **Shared Resources**:
   - Shared widgets go in the `widgets/` folder, making them easy to reuse across features.
   - Shared utility functions or extensions go in the `utils/` folder.

4. **Models**:
   - Define data models specific to each feature in `models/`. For example, `DeviceModel` for devices and `AIResponseModel` for AI-related data.

5. **Services**:
   - If a feature interacts with an API or backend (like AI APIs for `ai_tab`), add the logic in the `services/` folder (e.g., `ai_service.dart`).

---

### Example Workflow for Adding a Feature (e.g., AI Tab)

1. **UI**: Create `ai_tab_screen.dart` in `screens/`.
2. **Business Logic**: Add `ai_logic.dart` in `features/ai_tab/` for state management or AI-related logic.
3. **Widgets**: Add reusable widgets like an AI response card in `features/ai_tab/ai_widgets.dart`.
4. **Services**: If using an API, add `ai_service.dart` in `services/`.
5. **Models**: Add `AIResponseModel` in `models/` for handling API responses.
6. **Integration**: Connect everything in `ai_tab_screen.dart` and include it in your app's navigation (e.g., `BottomNavigationBar` or `Drawer`).

### Why This Structure is Friendly for Tabs and Features

- **Simplicity**: Tabs are represented as screens, with related logic and widgets grouped under `features/`.
- **Scalability**: Adding more tabs (e.g., `profile_tab`, `analytics_tab`) simply requires creating a new folder in `features/` and adding its screen to `screens/`.
- **Reusability**: Common widgets (like buttons or spinners) are centralized, reducing duplication.
- **Maintainability**: Feature-specific logic and UI are isolated, making the code easier to debug and extend.
