### **UI Components Consistency**
To ensure consistency across the app:
1. **Buttons**: Use a primary color (e.g., blue) for action buttons and secondary color (e.g., gray) for less prominent actions.
2. **Typography**: Clear and readable fonts (e.g., Open Sans or Roboto).
3. **Spacing**: Adequate padding between elements for touch-friendly interaction.
4. **Icons**: Use standard icons (Material Icons or Font Awesome) for email, Google, GitHub, and other elements.
5. **Feedback**: Show loaders during processing (e.g., "Verifying...").
